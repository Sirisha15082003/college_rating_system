# College Rating System  

I developed a College Rating System that allows students to anonymously rate colleges based on factors like placements and infrastructure.  

### Key Features:  
- Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript for an intuitive UI.  
- Authentication: Secure sign-up/login with user details.  
- Backend: PHP, Python, MySQL for data handling.  
- Anonymous Ratings: Users rate colleges (1-5 stars); system computes average ratings.  
- Dashboard: Displays user ratings & overall stats, keeping identities private.  
- Engagement: Users can *like reviews* to promote interaction.  

This platform ensures transparent and secure college evaluations.
